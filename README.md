# The Odin Project: Battleship
This project is mainly an exercise in using Jest for unit testing. Three data models were tested: Ship, Gameboard, and Player. The rules of the game are based off of the 1990 Milton Bradley version of the game. If I were to make another pass at this project, I would split up GameController.js into smaller files and I would also make the UI a bit more fancy.
